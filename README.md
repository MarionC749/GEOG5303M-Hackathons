# GEOG5303M-Hackathons
5 Hackathons conducted as part of my MSc studies

**Course:** GEOG5303M - Creative Coding for Real World Problems

Each hackathon was conducted as part of a group project in collaboration with an industry partner.

## Descriptions of projects

**Hackathon 1:** Assessing Green Connectivity in Leeds (with Healthy and Sustainable Places Data Service)

I conducted a network analysis to evaluate how parks in Leeds are connected to each other via public pathways, identifying green spaces that are isolated to suggest opportunities for the creation of green corridors. Green corridors present anthropogenic, biodiversity and environmental benefits.

**Hackathon 2:** 
Heat Resilience Index (with Martello): Built a heat resilience index for property evaluation, using Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data in Leeds. Developed and tested Python scripts for cleaning, processing and modelling large spatial datasets. Addressed significant data quality issues through imputation, external data sourcing and documentation. Created a weighted matrix to create resilience and improvement scores informing the property-level climate change reports of the company.


**Hackathon 3:**
High Street Health Assessment (with Population Health Improvement (PHI) UK): Delivered spatial analysis to identify high streets and assess their health in Liverpool and Bradford. Used POI data, DBSCAN clustering, buffering and proximity analysis in Python. Results were integrated with demographic and air quality data by the team, directly informing the clientâ€™s Health Urban Places research. 


**Hackathon 4:**
Natural Flood Management (with Mott MacDonald):  Supported the development of a nature-based solutions mapping tool by identifying opportunities for river re-meandering in the UK. As a team, conducted proximity, contour and sinuosity analyses, developed a watercourse scoring system, while writing reusable Python scripts for spatial data processing and visualisation. Outputs were integrated into QGIS for stakeholder engagement.
